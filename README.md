Official code release for the paper "Energy-Based Diffusion Language Models for Text Generation", accepted at *The 13th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2025*.

## Guidelines

Checkpoints of pretrained Diffusion and AR LLMs can be downloaded at [here](https://github.com/kuleshov-group/mdlm?tab=readme-ov-file#checkpoints).

### Hopper (cluster)

To run on GMU's Hopper cluster (modules, venv, data layout, example sbatch), see **[HOPPER_SETUP.md](HOPPER_SETUP.md)**.

### Colab (optional)

To run in Google Colab (install scripts and Hydra overrides for Drive paths), see **[colab/COLAB.md](colab/COLAB.md)**.

Save checkpoints to `checkpoints` folder, *e.g.*, `checkpoints/ar.ckpt`. Then you can run training and evaluation scripts in the `scripts` directory. We suggest you trying `scripts/job_sample_eval_owt_T_arebm.sh` and `scripts/job_eval_owt_T_arebm.sh` first, which don't involve any training.

More detailed guidelines for using this repository will be provided soon.
